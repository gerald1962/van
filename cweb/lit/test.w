@ Knuth means, that a programmer at any time is able to understand,
what you do and therefore it should be able to left ideas
as comments except you get low. I refere to "Literate Programming", see
{\tt knuth\_lit.pdf}: "Instead of imagining that our
main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us
concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what
we want a computer to do."
