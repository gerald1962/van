@** Introduction.
This is the reconstruction program \.{LIP} by Gerald Schueller
based on the \.{CWEAVE} program by Silvio Levy and Donald E. Knuth.

@ \.{LIP} has a fairly straightforward outline. It operates in
three phases: First it inputs the source file and stores cross-reference
data, then it inputs the source once again and produces the \TEX/ output
file, finally it sorts and outputs the index.

@c
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        return 0;
}

@** Index.
